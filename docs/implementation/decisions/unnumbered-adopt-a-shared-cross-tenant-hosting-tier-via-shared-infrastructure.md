# Decision: adopt a shared cross-tenant hosting tier via shared-infrastructure/isolated-data, not shared-schema multi-tenancy

[← Decision log](../DECISIONS.md)


### Context
`ENTERPRISE-SCALE.md`'s Br1 ("one deployment serves exactly one brand")
already names the two conditions under which serving several brands from a
shared operation becomes warranted, and explicitly instructs "do not build
toward this speculatively" until one is real. A request to actually build
a shared, cross-tenant hosting tier is exactly the second condition
("the per-deployment cost stops being justifiable per client") being
exercised on purpose, and doc 39
(`39-shared-cross-tenant-hosting-tier.md`) is the resulting brief. This
entry exists because *how* to share a hosting operation across tenants has
two structurally different answers with very different risk profiles, and
the choice needed to be made explicitly rather than left to whoever
implements doc 39 first.

### Options Considered
1. **Shared-schema multi-tenancy**: one application, one database, every
   table carries a `tenantId`, every query filtered by it.
2. **Shared-infrastructure, isolated-data**: one shared compute/
   orchestration/billing/support layer (the control plane), but every
   tenant keeps its own, fully separate database and application instance
   — a tenant is a node, exactly as `RETAIL-ERP.md` R2/R7 already treat a
   branch.

### Decision
**Option 2.** A tenant's business data is never in the same database, the
same query, or the same schema as another tenant's. The control plane
(`PlatformTenant`, billing, support access) lives in its own separate
database and only ever routes traffic and meters usage — it never reads or
writes a tenant's own business tables.

### Reasoning
Option 1 would introduce a **second, competing isolation model** next to
the one this repository has already built its entire replication and
branch-scoping architecture on (R2/R7's "a node has its own database and is
authoritative for its own facts"). Every isolation guarantee this
repository already makes — tenant/branch-scoped queries, `PermissionsGuard`,
the whole "whose rows, and which columns" lens answered independently in
every document from 20 onward — would need to be re-proven under a shared
schema, where a single missing `WHERE tenantId =` clause is a cross-
customer data breach. Option 2 needs none of that: a request that reaches
the wrong tenant's application instance still cannot reach any other
tenant's database, because no code path exists that connects them. This is
`CLAUDE.md`'s own "can the existing system already solve this?" question,
answered yes — the node/database-per-branch pattern already solves tenant
isolation at one level; this decision is applying it at the level above,
not inventing a new one.

### Consequences
- The cost saving this tier exists to capture comes entirely from the
  compute/operations/billing layer (shared provisioning automation, shared
  monitoring, shared support tooling), not from consolidating data — a
  real, smaller saving than shared-schema multi-tenancy would offer, traded
  deliberately for not having to build and continuously prove a second
  isolation model correct.
- Every tenant's own deployment remains, from its own point of view, an
  ordinary single-brand deployment exactly as Br1 already describes —
  `brand.ts`, the `MODULES` allowlist, and every existing document in this
  set apply completely unchanged inside any one tenant's instance. Nothing
  about this decision touches how a single tenant's own system behaves.
- `SupportAccessGrant` (doc 39 §3) becomes the one new, genuinely
  higher-trust capability this tier introduces — a Newax hosting-ops
  engineer who can, in principle, reach into a tenant's isolated
  deployment for support. It is bounded by an expiry and a full audit
  trail specifically because it is the one place where "isolated data"
  still has a deliberate, narrow, logged door in it.
- `ENTERPRISE-SCALE.md`'s Br1 section and `CLAUDE.md`'s three-axes bullet
  each gain a short pointer to doc 39, the same way `RETAIL-ERP.md` itself
  amended `CLAUDE.md`'s Branch row when it introduced the node/database
  model for chains — Br1 itself is not rewritten, since it still correctly
  describes every individual tenant's own deployment; the pointer only
  names where the control-plane exception is specified.

### Status
**Accepted.**
