# ADR-018 — Horizontal replicas and load balancing

[← Decision log](../DECISIONS.md)


### Context
The deployment is one process per node (ADR-001). A load balancer is a box a
reference architecture names, and `CLAUDE.md` records it as "not applicable at
today's single-process-per-node scale" — with the explicit condition that when a
node needs horizontal replicas, it "gets a real answer in `DECISIONS.md` before
it gets an env var".

### Options Considered
Not yet evaluated. The decision is not only the balancer: replicas make process
state a correctness question. The outbox dispatcher (ADR-004), the cron jobs and
the replication sync agent all currently assume a single runner per node.

### Decision
**None yet.** Recorded so the condition `CLAUDE.md` set is discharged in the
open rather than by the first person who needs more throughput.

### Reasoning
No deployment has presented the load that would justify it, and adding replicas
without first deciding leader election for the scheduled and draining work would
produce duplicate cron runs and competing outbox dispatchers — a correctness
failure, not a scaling one. That coupling is the substance of this decision and
is the reason it cannot be reduced to an env var.

### Consequences
- Until decided, background work may continue to assume a single runner per node.
- Whoever takes this up owns the leader-election question for
  `OutboxDispatcher`, every `@Cron` job (`docs/index/cross/jobs.md` lists them)
  and `ReplicationSyncAgent` — not just the balancer.

### Status
**Open.** Triggered by the first node that needs horizontal replicas.
