# ADR-005 — Money is an integer in minor units

[← Decision log](../DECISIONS.md)


### Context
The system computes prices, discounts, tax, refunds, ledger postings and
multi-currency conversions, and any rounding disagreement between two of them is
a real financial defect.

### Options Considered
- Floating point.
- A decimal type in the database, floats in application code.
- Integer minor units (paisa) end to end.

### Decision
**Integer paisa, everywhere.** Rs 3,499 is `349900`. Never a float.

### Reasoning
Floating point cannot represent most decimal money values exactly, so equality
and summation become approximate in a domain where they must not be. Mixing a
database decimal with application floats just moves the defect to the boundary.
An integer is exact, sums exactly, and compares exactly.

Long-form: `00-HOUSE-RULES.md` Rule 5; extended to multi-currency by
`RETAIL-ERP.md` R16.

### Consequences
- Every amount needs formatting at the edge — `formatMoney` from `@newax/shared`,
  never `toLocaleString` at a call site.
- Multi-currency uses a scaled integer rate (`fxRateScaled`) for the same reason.
- A new money column that is not an integer is a defect, not a style choice.

### Status
Accepted.
