# ADR-001 — A modular monolith, one process per node

[← Decision log](../DECISIONS.md)


### Context
The product serves several sectors, several clients, and clients with several
branches, and it has to stay extensible for sectors nobody has specified yet. The
shape of the deployment had to be settled before any module boundary meant
anything.

### Options Considered
- A microservice mesh, one service per business capability.
- A single application with no internal boundaries.
- A modular monolith: one deployable process, with enforced internal boundaries.

### Decision
A **deliberate modular monolith** — one NestJS process per node, with module
boundaries enforced in the repository rather than by the network.

### Reasoning
The boundaries a mesh buys are real, but so is its cost: a distributed
transaction problem on every write that spans two capabilities, an operational
surface no single-shop deployment can staff, and a deployment story that a
client running one till cannot run at all. The boundaries can be had without the
network — `scripts/check-module-boundaries.mjs` fails the build on a violation,
which is a stricter guarantee than a mesh gives, because a mesh permits any call
that compiles.

Long-form: `ENTERPRISE-SCALE.md`, `RETAIL-ERP.md`.

### Consequences
- Every infrastructure box a reference architecture names still has to exist, but
  inside the process: the API gateway is the entrypoint's own hardening, the
  cache is a precomputed table, and so on. `CLAUDE.md` maps each one.
- A module cannot be scaled independently. If one ever must be, that is a new
  decision, not a silent refactor.
- The boundary rules become load-bearing: they are the only thing standing
  between this and an unmodular monolith.

### Status
Accepted.
