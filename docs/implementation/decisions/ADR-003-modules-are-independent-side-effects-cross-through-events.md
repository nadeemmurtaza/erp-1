# ADR-003 — Modules are independent; side effects cross through events

[← Decision log](../DECISIONS.md)


### Context
Module packs only pay off if a module can actually be dropped, replaced, or
shipped alone for a client. A single direct import between two modules destroys
that property quietly.

### Options Considered
- Allow direct service calls between modules, relying on review.
- Allow them within a pack, forbid them across packs.
- Forbid them entirely, with a named exception list for same-transaction writes.

### Decision
**No direct import between any two modules**, core or pack alike. Side effects
cross through a domain event or an extension point. `KNOWN_MODULE_COUPLINGS` in
`scripts/check-module-boundaries.mjs` is the only exception, and it stays small
on purpose.

### Reasoning
The middle option was the first rule and it left the real gap: two core modules
could import each other freely, which is most of the codebase. The exception
list exists because a small number of writes genuinely must commit in the same
database transaction as the write that caused them — an order's stock deduction
is the clearest case, and decoupling it through an event would trade a
correctness guarantee for architectural purity, reintroducing exactly the race
that House Rule 10's predicate-on-write exists to eliminate.

Long-form: `00-HOUSE-RULES.md` Rules 2 and 3; `MULTI-SECTOR.md`.

### Consequences
- Adding behaviour to another module's workflow is a new file, not an edit.
- The exception list is a burn-down list, not a configuration knob. Each entry is
  a place the platform is less portable than it claims.
- `pnpm idx event <name>` shows every publisher and subscriber, because the
  indirection makes the wiring invisible in the source.

### Status
Accepted.
