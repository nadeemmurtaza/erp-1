# ADR-020 — `bom` (Track C) ships as a new module, `production` stays as-is

[← Decision log](../DECISIONS.md)


### Context
RETAIL-ERP.md's Tranche 6 names `23.2` `bom` — "build `10-admin-dashboard.md`
§C as written." Before starting, a survey of the current repository found
`apps/api/src/modules/supply-chain/production/` already implements a working, tested,
**actively depended-on** BOM-and-manufacturing mechanism: `BillOfMaterial`/
`BillOfMaterialLine` (a `ProductVariant` built from other `ProductVariant`s,
generic float quantities, no raw-material concept) and `WorkOrder`
(DRAFT → RELEASED → COMPLETED, consuming and producing stock through
`InventoryService.move()`/`moveMany()`). Two other modules call into it:
`apps/api/src/modules/supply-chain/production/reorder-work-order.listener.ts` and
`stitching-cascade.listener.ts` both create `WorkOrder`s as a live part of
the reorder and stitching pipelines — this is not dead or scaffolded code.

Track C (`10-admin-dashboard.md` §C, WO-C.1 through WO-C.4) specifies a
different, more capable system: `RawMaterial` (a `ProductVariant` marker
row with a unit-scale discipline for continuous goods — fabric measured in
milli-gaz, not just countable pieces), `BomRecipe`/`BomComponent` with a
cached, cost-rolled-up recipe, `BomProductionRun`/`BomProductionLine` with
wastage-adjusted consumption and a weighted-average cost write-through to
the finished variant's `costPrice` — none of which exists anywhere in the
repository today. It is a net-new build, not a partially-done module the
existing `production` code is a slice of.

### Options Considered
1. **Build `bom` as a new, separate module**, alongside `production`,
   leaving `BillOfMaterial`/`WorkOrder` untouched. Chosen.
2. **Merge `bom` into the `production` module** — extend `WorkOrder` with
   raw-material/recipe/wastage/cost-rollup concepts in place. Rejected: the
   two solve overlapping but distinct problems (an assembly BOM of finished
   variants vs. a raw-material recipe with a unit-scale and cost discipline
   Track C's own schema comments call out as load-bearing — "QUANTITIES ARE
   INTEGER BASE UNITS, the same discipline money uses"). Forcing them into
   one model risks the same "the wizard was a card, and every step inside
   it drew another" kind of accretion CLAUDE.md's UI rules warn about, but
   for a data model: `WorkOrder` gains fields most of its existing callers
   (reorder, stitching-cascade) never use.
3. **Deprecate `production`'s BOM mechanism and migrate its two callers to
   the new `bom` module as part of this work order.** Rejected as this
   work order's scope: CLAUDE.md's own "Preserve existing systems" and
   "Change minimization" — rewriting two shipped, working listeners because
   a new, unrelated module now exists nearby is a refactor with no stated
   requirement driving it, and would turn a scoped feature build into an
   unscoped migration of code nothing asked to change.

### Decision
Build `bom` as specified in Track C, as its own module (`modules.registry.ts`
entry `{ name: 'bom', module: BomModule }`, its own `bom.prisma`, its own
`bom.view`/`bom.manage`/`bom.produce` permissions, its own nav group). The
existing `production` module — `BillOfMaterial`, `WorkOrder`, both
listeners — is not touched, not deprecated, and not documented as
superseded by this work.

### Reasoning
The two modules answer different questions (`production`: "this variant is
assembled from these other variants"; `bom`: "this variant is manufactured
from these raw materials, with wastage and a real weighted-average cost").
Reconciling or merging them is a real design question worth having, but it
is not one Track C's own spec asks for, has no stated requirement in this
work order, and — per CLAUDE.md's own scoping method — a lens with no
artifact behind it is not this feature's to invent. Coexistence is also the
reversible choice: either module can still be merged, retired or renamed
later without this decision having foreclosed it, whereas quietly
absorbing `production` into `bom` now would not be undoable without a
second migration.

### Consequences
- A `ProductVariant` can in principle carry both a `BillOfMaterial` (generic
  assembly) and a `RawMaterial` marker (a raw-material role) at once today —
  nothing in either model prevents it. Track C's own acceptance criteria
  don't ask this repo to resolve that overlap, so it is not resolved here;
  a future work order that wants one unified "how is this variant made"
  answer will need to design that reconciliation explicitly, informed by
  how each is actually used once `bom` ships.
- Two conceptually similar systems now exist side by side
  (`production.manage` and the new `bom.*` permissions gate two different
  screens for two different kinds of "production"). This is named here so
  it is a known, deliberate state rather than something a future reader
  has to rediscover from the code.
- WO-23.3 (tier-scoped purchasing, RETAIL-ERP.md R13) explicitly bundles
  `PurchaseOrder`, `BomProductionRun` and `Expense` under one shared
  `scopeLevel`/`originNodeId` pattern — it is sequenced after `bom` lands,
  specifically after `BomProductionRun` (WO-C.3) exists, so that pattern is
  designed once against a real model rather than speculatively.

### Status
**Accepted.**
