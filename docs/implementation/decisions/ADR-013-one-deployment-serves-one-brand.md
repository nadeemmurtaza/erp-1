# ADR-013 — One deployment serves one brand

[← Decision log](../DECISIONS.md)


### Context
Several clients run this platform. Multi-brand could be a runtime concern or a
build-time one, and the choice shapes every query in the system.

### Options Considered
- Multi-brand at runtime, with a brand resolved per request.
- One deployment per brand, brand resolved at build time.

### Decision
**One deployment serves one brand**, resolved at build time from
`packages/shared/src/brand.ts`.

### Reasoning
Runtime multi-brand puts a brand filter on every query and a brand check in
every permission, and one missed filter is a cross-client data leak. Build-time
resolution makes that class of bug unrepresentable. The cost is a deployment per
client, which is already the operating model.

### Consequences
- **Do not build toward multi-brand speculatively.** It is a deliberate
  boundary, not an unfinished feature.
- Brand, locale and design literals resolve through `BRAND` — no hex, no company
  name, no support address in application code (House Rule 1).
- The `RetailBrand` rows that exist are sub-brands within one deployment's
  brand, which is a different axis and must not be confused with this one.

### Status
Accepted.
